The purported solution is tested in two ways:
1) By exhaustively running through every possible scenario in which two prizes are placed (i.e. A,A; A,B; A,C etc.) and playing out each scenario according to the game's rules, counting the number of scenarios where Andrew wins vs. the number of scnearios where Barbara wins.
2) By running a simulation millions of times in which two prizes are randomly placed. The number of times Andrew wins vs. the number of times Barbara wins is tallied and compared at the end. This method is reliant on the random distribution of prizes being even, so there are also tests to assert this.
